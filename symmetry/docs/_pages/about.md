## Project Summary

This project reproduces some of the figures found in "Symmetry in Chaos A Search for Pattern in Mathematics, Second Edition" by Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky.
If you haven't had the opportunity to read their book, it's fascinating and its images otherworldy. I loved the book and found reproducing its pictures irresistible.
